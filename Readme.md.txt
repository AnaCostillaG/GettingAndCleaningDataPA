Getting and Cleaning Data, Peer Assesment

This github repository contains the 3 files resulting from the project of the Getting and Cleaning Data course in coursera getdata-003
See instructions in https://class.coursera.org/getdata-003/human_grading/view/courses/972136/assessments/3/submissions
To obtain the dataset in a file format run the run_analysis.R, this assumes that you have loaded most of the packages so please in case it fails make sure to load the other packages. It will not assume that you have already downloaded the information.

To see the explanations behind each data transformation read the CODEBOOK located in there.

The file with the resulting dataset is not included in the repository, as it was not explicitly required in the coursework.

Please feel free to fork or use this information to better understand R, I know it has helped me.
